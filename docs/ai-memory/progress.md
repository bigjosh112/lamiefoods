# Progress log

> Running task log, **newest first**. Written by the `log-progress` skill after every
> completed task. Purpose: a fresh session (any model) reads the top few entries and
> knows exactly where the project stands — what just happened, what's mid-flight, and
> what's next. Keep entries short; depth belongs in the other docs.

## YYYY-MM-DD — <task title>

- **Done:** <what shipped, 1–3 bullets>
- **Files:** <key files touched>
- **Decisions:** <any decision made — if architectural, it ALSO goes in architecture.md>
- **Docs updated:** <which memory docs were updated, or "none needed">
- **Gaps:** <new GAP-IDs opened / closed, or "none">
- **Next / open threads:** <what a fresh session should pick up>

## 2026-09-05 — Fixed GAP-002 (sitemap 404s)

- **Done:** Trimmed `sitemap.ts` to only the home route; `/shop`, `/about`, and product
  URLs re-added via comment as each page ships. No more indexable 404s in the sitemap.
- **Files:** `apps/web/src/app/sitemap.ts`.
- **Verify:** `npm run typecheck --workspace=@lamiefoods/web` passes; `sitemap()` now
  returns only `ROUTES.home`, which renders (200).
- **Gaps:** GAP-002 closed (working tree, uncommitted).
- **Next / open threads:** GAP-001 (test runner) still open. Changes are uncommitted —
  commit when ready.

## 2026-09-05 — Audited gaps

- **Done:** First gap audit (security → tests → edge → tech-debt). Security pass clean:
  `npm audit` 0 vulns, secrets gated behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` + zod validation, JSON-LD
  escapes `<`, error boundary logs (not renders) errors, `.env.local` untracked.
- **Files:** read-only across `apps/web` (app routes, seo, api, config, env files),
  `packages/*`, `.gitignore`. Ran `npm audit` and `git ls-files`.
- **Gaps:** opened **GAP-001** (no test runner in any workspace — medium) and
  **GAP-002** (sitemap advertises unbuilt `/shop` + `/about` → indexable 404s — low).
- **Decisions:** Did **not** file `apiFetch` throwing `ApiNotConfiguredError` as a gap —
  it's an intentional, documented first-class state with zero callers today, not a
  weakness.
- **Docs updated:** gaps.md, progress.md.
- **Next / open threads:** Address GAP-002 before any public deploy; stand up a test
  runner (GAP-001) when the first money/cart logic lands. Re-audit once real
  pages/API calls exist — most of the app surface doesn't exist to audit yet.

## 2026-09-05 — Documented architecture

- **Done:** Derived `architecture.md` from the real code (entry points, api gateway,
  env validation, tokens, shared packages, backend stub). Replaced the empty template
  with mental model, system map, data flow, 14 key decisions, 9 gotchas, glossary.
- **Files:** `docs/ai-memory/architecture.md` (read-only exploration of `apps/web`,
  `packages/*`, `apps/backend`, configs).
- **Decisions:** All existing decisions had genuine, code-derivable rationale — none
  invented. Two unknowns resolved with the owner and folded in: pnpm→npm was for
  tooling/host compatibility, and the deploy target is **Vercel** (also filled into
  CLAUDE.md's Deploy line).
- **Docs updated:** architecture.md, progress.md.
- **Gaps:** none opened yet — recommend running audit-gaps next (candidates noticed:
  no test runner in any workspace; `apiFetch` throws `ApiNotConfiguredError` for every
  call until the backend is wired).
- **Next / open threads:** Get answers to the two UNCONFIRMED items and fold them in.
  Then run audit-gaps. Fill frontend-conventions tokens are already largely captured in
  globals.css.

## <YYYY-MM-DD> — Kit installed

- **Done:** AI memory kit installed; CLAUDE.md placeholders filled.
- **Next / open threads:** <existing repo: run document-architecture, then audit-gaps.
  new repo: fill frontend-conventions tokens as the design system forms.>
